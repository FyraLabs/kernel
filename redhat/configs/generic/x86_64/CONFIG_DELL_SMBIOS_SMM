# The dell-smbios driver was enabled in RHEL7 through bug 1396495.
# In Linux 4.15, it was splitted in two drivers: dell-smbios and
# dell-smbios-smm (commit 549b4930f057 upstream). After this split, a WMI based
# driver was also added right after (commit 1a258e670434). Due these changes, we
# had to pick SMM/WMI versions of the drivers, we chose WMI driver while the SMM
# driver was disabled by default (bug 1551012). Starting with 4.16 kernel,
# WMI/SMM driver can only be built-in in the dell-smbios module. We keep
# WMI part enabled while SMM stays disabled as before.

# CONFIG_DELL_SMBIOS_SMM is not set
