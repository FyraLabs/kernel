# Bug 1550920 enabled Mellanox platform support kernel options for kernel 4.15,
# including CONFIG_MLX_CPLD_PLATFORM. However starting with 4.16 kernel, since
# upstream commit 1f976f6978bf ("platform/x86: Move Mellanox platform hotplug
# driver to platform/mellanox"), CONFIG_MLX_CPLD_PLATFORM was renamed to
# CONFIG_MLXREG_HOTPLUG, and depends on CONFIG_MELLANOX_PLATFORM being enabled.
# (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560751)
CONFIG_MLXREG_HOTPLUG=m
